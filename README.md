# Real-Time Object Detection with YOLOv4 on Colab

## Overview
This repository demonstrates how to use YOLOv4 for real-time object detection on Google Colab. It includes steps to clone and build Darknet, perform object detection on images and video streams, and overlay bounding boxes with labels and confidence scores.

## Features
- Clone and build Darknet with GPU, OpenCV, and CUDNN support.
- Load YOLOv4 weights and perform object detection.
- Capture images and stream video from a webcam with bounding box overlays.
